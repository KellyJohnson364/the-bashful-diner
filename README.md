# The Bashful Diner

## Description
This application was designed for those that struggle with or would prefer to limit in-person communication while visiting a restaurant. For more quiet shy folks. For those that enjoy dining out but not necessarily the human interaction element. For people that are hearing impaired or part of the deaf community. Have a night out, but still feel the comfort of having the night in! The Bashful Diner aims to provide the user an exclusive dining experience while enjoying delicious foods at your favorite eatery!

* When the guest arrives at a given restuarant they are able to enter their name and table number.
* Once logged in the guest is able to access the full menu.
* When the guest selects a menu item it is added to the order. They can order multiple items from the menu.
* The guest can make special requests to customize their meal.
* Once the order has been placed the guest will receive status updates as their order progresses.
* The guest can add-on to the order at any time.
* When the guest orders an additional item, they can see that it has been added to the order and the eta or the order will be adjusted.
* When the guest searches for a specific kind of meal or dietary requirement, they are presented with a list of meals that fall under that category (i.e.; vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)
* If the guest needs they can request to speak to a server and the server will be notified to visit their table.
* When the guest has finished their meal, they are able to view the bill and request to cash out.
* When the guest is viewing the bill the sales tax, and service fee is calculated and added to the total bill.
* When the staff member arrives at work they are able to login using their username and password.

APIs? Heroku? Eh?

## Future Development
In the future we'd love to see our vision grow to include the ability to pay within the application and to include multiple language options to increase accessibility. Ideally we'd like to see this application allow the user search for restaurants and be able to select from a list of establishments nearby.
