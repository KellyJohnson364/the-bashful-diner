# The Bashful Diner

## Description
This application was designed for those that struggle with or would prefer to limit in-person communication while visiting a restaurant. For more quiet shy folks. For those that enjoy dining out but not necessarily the human interaction element. For people that are hearing impaired or part of the deaf community. Have a night out, but still feel the comfort of having the night in! The Bashful Diner aims to provide the user an uninterrupted dining experience while enjoying delicious foods at your favorite eatery!

* When the user creates an account and logs in, they are able to find their restaurant and are presented with a form to fill out with their name and table number.
* The user is able to access the full menu.
* When the user selects a menu item it is added to the order. They can order multiple items from the menu.
* Once the order has been placed the user will receive status updates as their order progresses.
* The user can make special requests and customize their orders.
* The user can add-on to the order at any time.
* When the user orders an additional item, they can see that it has been added to the order and the eta or the order will be adjusted.
* When the user searches for a specific kind of meal or dietary requirement, they are presented with a list of meals that fall under that category (i.e.; vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)
* If the user needs they can request a refill or call a server to the table.
* When the user has finished their meal, they are able to view the bill and request to cash out.
* When the user is viewing the bill the tip is calculated for them.
